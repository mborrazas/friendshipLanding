                <button class="accordion">Who are Friendship Lamps designed for?</button>
                <div class="panel">
                    <p>A Friendship Lamp is ideal for anyone looking for a unique way to stay in touch with their loved
                        ones. Whether you have family spread across the world, are currently in a long-distance
                        relationship, or have a special friend you'd like to stay in touch with, our Friendship Lamps
                        are specially made for you. In fact, it's even a great piece to place in your office and connect
                        with your family and friends at any time of the day. Regardless of your location or theirs, a
                        Friendship Lamp is the best way to send your love across miles.</p>
                </div>

                <button class="accordion">Can this lamp be used as a table lamp, night lamp, or for ambient
                    lighting?</button>
                <div class="panel">
                    <p>You can use the lamp however you like! But remember: every time you touch it, all other lamps
                        connected to the same group ID will light up.</p>
                </div>

                <button class="accordion">Does the other lamp light up as soon as I touch mine? Is there any
                    delay?</button>
                <div class="panel">
                    <p>Yes, the other lamp or lamps light up as soon as you touch your lamp. There is no delay unless
                        there is an issue with the Wi-Fi connection at either end.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <button class="accordion">How many lamps can be connected?</button>
                <div class="panel">
                    <p>Friendship lamps are fun to use with one person or in a small, medium, or large group! Just make
                        sure all lamps in that group use the same group ID. Once entered into each lamp, you'll be able
                        to send your fun greeting to your entire group.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <button class="accordion">Unlimited colors of Friendship Lamps.</button>
                <div class="panel">
                    <p>Friendship lamps have unlimited colors, as you can choose exactly what color you want using our
                        app. By using the app, you can choose any shade of color you desire, so you're not limited at
                        all by your color choice.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <button class="accordion">What do I need to connect the lamp?</button>
                <div class="panel">
                    <p>Electrical connection <br>
                        Our Friendship Lamps are connected via USB, so all you need is an exclusive power adapter with a
                        USB port and you'll be ready to go. We don't provide a power adapter, so you can use the same
                        type of adapter you would use for your phone charger. All you need to do is plug in the USB
                        cable that comes in the box with the Friendship Lamp.
                        WiFi requirements<br>
                        Lamps need to be connected to WiFi to function. Currently, they are only compatible with 2.4GHz
                        WiFi. This is the current standard and has better range. However, most newer routers of 5 GHz
                        also have an option for 2.4 GHz WiFi. If there is no WiFi connection available, you can also
                        connect the lamp to a mobile hotspot or public WiFi (such as university WiFi).
                        <br>
                        App installation
                        <br>
                        Friendship Lamps require a unique setup, and you'll need to install the HuugLight app on your
                        iOS or Android phone to connect it to your WiFi.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <button class="accordion">Can I connect my Friendship Lamp to multiple groups?</button>
                <div class="panel">
                    <p>Yes, of course.</p>
                </div>
                <button class="accordion">What is the maximum distance between two lamps?</button>
                <div class="panel">
                    <p>Are you wondering if your lamp will still connect if your friend/relative is on the other side of
                        the world?
                        Good news!
                        There is no limit to the distance between two lamps. Our lamps are connected worldwide and can
                        also be connected within your own home (on the same WiFi).
